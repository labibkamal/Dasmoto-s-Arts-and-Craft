# Dasmoto's Arts and Craft

## Description

This is an off-platform website built form my local environment. The website was builtfollowing the redline template that can be found in resources/images/dasmotos-arts-redline.webp . The project showcases my first attempt of building a website writting my own html and css script using Visual Studio Code and linking them together.
